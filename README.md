Memory Lane
-----------

Memory Lane is a Next.js project designed to help you summarize notes with the help of AI. 

Project Overview
----------------

Memory Lane is a web application that allows users to create, store, and revisit their personal notes in a digital format. Currently, it serves as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with in-memory storage, but future implementations will include local storage and vector database integration for more advanced RAG-style interactions.

Features
--------

-   Digital Memory Storage: Currently stores memories in-memory (temporary storage)
-   Minimalist User Interface: Clean, simple design for effortless navigation
-   Customizable Memory Cards: Add photos, notes, and dates to your memories
-   Responsive Design: Access your memories on any device

Upcoming Features
-----------------

-   Local storage implementation for persistent memory storage
-   Vector database integration for advanced memory retrieval and interactions
-   Search and filter functionality to quickly find specific memories

Getting Started
---------------

To run Memory Lane on your local machine:

1.  Clone the repository:

    bash

    `git clone https://github.com/luiscrvm/memory-lane.git cd memory-lane `

2.  Install dependencies:

    bash

    `npm  install  `

3.  Run the development server:

    bash

    `npm run dev `

4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to see the application.

Technology Stack
----------------

-   Next.js: React framework for production-grade applications
-   React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
-   Vercel: Platform for deploying and hosting web applications
-   Geist Font: Custom font family for enhanced typography

Current Limitations
-------------------

-   Memories are only stored in-memory and are lost upon page refresh
-   Search and filter features are not yet implemented
-   User interface is basic and requires significant improvements
